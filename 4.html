				<h2>The SMG, and it’s fall from significance</h2>

					<p>Originally designed in a time of slow firing, heavy rifles, the sub machine gun, or SMG, filled a role that very few other weapons could without sacrificing ease of carry or low cost, but today its benefit has been reduced to near nonexistence on the modern battlefield.</p>

					<p>In the years spanning the two infamous great wars, most men in the infantry were given a large, heavy, manually loading rifle.  Though at the time, the bolt action rifle was considered a vast improvement in reliability and rate of fire, even if it only brought it up to about 30 rounds a minute, depending on how familiar a man was with his rifle.  Light machine guns did supplement many squads as well, but it was far heavier, and often times required a small team in order to use effectively.</p>

					<p>In this environment, the SMG provided a niche utilization that was severely needed by the men.  Though it sacrificed power and range for its rapid, sustained fire, unlike the automatic rifles, it in return provided a very small and very light firearm that a single man could operate effectively and efficiently.  Whether it was used for short range, makeshift suppression solutions or self defense for officers and vehicle cewmen, there was little else that could do what the SMG did, making it indispensable for many situations.</p>

					<p>After the wars, and in subsequent ones, the class of firearm continued to be useful for many.  However, even as SMGs became more effective, automatic rifles were developing along side them.  The advent and development of the intermediary cartridge, and the assault rifles that fired them, ushered in a new age of firearms.</p>

					<p>It took time for the automatic rifle to become cheap enough and compact enough to put in the hands of every soldier on the front lines, but once they did, there was little they couldn’t do.  With the introduction of the M16 and AK-47 rifles, most men had the ability to provide better suppressive fire, relegating pistol calibre guns to police and tank crews.  With the much shorter automatic carbines, such as the M4, even that role shrank more and more, becoming an excellent self defense weapon on the battlefield.</p>

					<p>As comfortable body armor that could resist pistol calibre rounds became more prevalent, the significance of the SMG became less relevant, making soldiers have to opt for the more powerful automatic rifles.  With the reduction of price of automatic carbines, the expensive, less effective SMGs became harder for police to justify using.</p>

					<p>Even the one role the SMG could outperform a rifle in, a tight environment, such as inside a building or vehicle, where every inch counts, it didn’t take long for even more designs to fulfill the role.  Bullpup rifles provided a new avenue for incredibly short rifles that could be used even inside a vehicle.  By placing the firing mechanism behind the trigger, a bullpup could be made to have a full length barrel in a rifle that’s only a little longer than the width of a man’s shoulders.</p>

					<p>Finally, in only the past decade, the final nail had been put in the SMG’s coffin.  New pistol cartridge sized rounds were developed at the request of NATO, designed to be smaller than much more common and battle tested 9mm rounds, the common size for pistols and SMGs, but packed enough penetrative power to punch through body armor.  The rise of the new classification of firearm, the personal defense weapon, or PDW, can be considered an evolution of the SMG into a more effective machine built around the modern age, however, it cannot be argued that the contemporary SMG would no longer fit in this definition, and be effectively phased out of usage.</p>

					<p>With smaller, lighter, more powerful weapons filling most roles in small arms usage, there’s very little room for an SMG in today’s climate.  With cheaper, more widespread options available to both military and civilians alike, there’s very few reasons to choose this type of weapon.  Once versatile and powerful, the SMG has been relegated to not much more than a 70 year old relic of the past.</p>
