				<h2>A Look at Light Attack Air Craft: An Economically Friendly Solution</h2>
				<p><span>October 7th, 2017</span></p>
				<img src=tucano.jpg>

				<p>The United State’s modern air force boasts the most advanced aircraft the world has ever seen, and has developed and tested the very bleeding edge of aircraft effectiveness for decades.  This has kept the US ahead of the world and placed it at the very top of air superiority, currently being the only nation to field fifth generation aircraft, more than capable of defeating most other air forces with ease.</p>

				<p>However, today’s modern military operations aren’t usually fought against technologically advanced armies that can boast powerful weapon systems of their own.  Often times, they are rag tag groups of poorly equipped rebellions or terrorist groups, who’s only options for warfare end up being guerrilla tactics.</p>

				<p>This means for the mighty jets like the roughly $100 million F-35, less than 250 of which have been built and used in operation, the problem becomes akin to using a hacksaw to cut butter.  When every operational hour shortens the lifespan of your weapon system significantly, the infrastructure to use the system becomes expensive in and of itself, and the enemy being fought is as far behind technologically as they are numerous in countless difficult to find foxholes and caves, the use of the biggest guns with the biggest punch becomes restrictive, unable to face as many threats as quickly, and only able to do so with a force considered overkill for the operation.</p>

				<h2>The SMG, and it’s fall from significance</h2>
				<p><span>October 14th, 2017</span></p>
				<img src=mp5.jpg alt="MP5">


					<p>Originally designed in a time of slow firing, heavy rifles, the sub machine gun, or SMG, filled a role that very few other weapons could without sacrificing ease of carry or low cost, but today its benefit has been reduced to near nonexistence on the modern battlefield.</p>

					<p>In the years spanning the two infamous great wars, most men in the infantry were given a large, heavy, manually loading rifle.  Though at the time, the bolt action rifle was considered a vast improvement in reliability and rate of fire, even if it only brought it up to about 30 rounds a minute, depending on how familiar a man was with his rifle.  Light machine guns did supplement many squads as well, but it was far heavier, and often times required a small team in order to use effectively.</p>
