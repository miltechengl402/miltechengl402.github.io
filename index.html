				<h2>Geckskin: The Next Generation of Adhesives</h2>

				<p>Have you ever wondered what scaling a wall like Spiderman would feel like? While the average person may not possess the ability to actively climb skyscrapers like Peter Parker, a new innovative technology may just give you this freedom.  This technology is known as Geckskin, a new super-adhesive based on the mechanics of gecko feet.  This new innovative technology is pushing the boundary of what adhesives are capable of, and elevating the standard for the application of adhesives.  So, whether it’s a military soldier scaling a wall, or a consumer hanging a television in their home, the possibilities are endless for Geckskin. </p>

				<h3>The People</h3>
				<p>Behind this new technology lies the people responsible for this innovative development.  Specifically, two people at the University of Massachusetts.  Professor Al Crosby and Professor Duncan J Irschick.  Crosby, a Professor in Polymer Science, and Engineering field, is a materials scientist focusing on the mechanics of soft materials and biological systems. He was the initial leader of the group that initially developed Geckskin, and holds several patents for technologies that have been derived from his teams focus in the science and engineering field.  Duncan J Irschick, a Professor in the Biology department, mainly focuses on the evolution and ecology of animal athletics and how their biological form can influence synthetic design.  His research on gecko adhesion and animal movement have received many awards and honors, and Irschicks early research involving the adhesive force of gecko toepads, set the standard for other biologists creating synthetic adhesives.  These two scientists don’t compose the entire Geckskin team though, as multiple other PhD graduate students and doctoral candidates are enlisted in this development of Geckskin.</p>
