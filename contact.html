				<h2>Press Release</h2>
				<p><span>October 17,2017</span></p>
				<p>To fellow Military enthusiasts,</p>
				<p>For everyone passionate and interested in the cutting-edge technology the U.S Military is developing, Militech is officially online and here to inform!  We will be releasing fresh content weekly with a hard copy edition hitting the shelves every month.   We welcome all advice on future articles that highlight innovative new technologies involved with our U.S Military, and welcome you to connect with our editors through our “Contact Us” tab.  </p>
				<p>Militech prides itself on exclusively offering information on what is being developed currently in the U.S Military.  We aim to inform on weapons, aircraft, and development of supplies for soldiers, among many other areas.  Militech is committed to connecting with the American people and inform what technologies are currently being used, soon to be developed, and what they could possibly see in their home soon.  We are committed to supplying accurate information, and directly use the input from our readers to focus our articles on what our readers desire to see.  This is where Miliitech separates itself from the competition.</p>
				<p>At Militech, we stand by what we produce, and our partnerships with The Department of Defense, U.S Army, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and U.S Navy, ensure we get precise and accurate information.  These partnerships allow us to not only inform, but help these branches of the military send their message to individuals looking for careers and willing to apply their education in a Military setting.   This way you can be assured that you are getting the correct information regarding the latest news and developments.</p>
				<p>At Militech we value our readers, and would like to reinstate the importance of your input as our personnel strive to expand on your curiosity.  Use the “Contact Us” tab on our site to send in what you would like to more information on in our U.S Military, Militech will strive to produce the best analysis of the latest technology being developed.</p>
