				<h2>Geckskin: The Next Generation of Adhesives</h2>
				<p><span>October 16, 2017</span></p>
				<img src="https://geckskin.umass.edu/sites/geckskin.umass.edu/files/images/tokay_gecko_gekko_gecko_toepad.jpg" alt="Geckskin">

				<p>Have you ever wondered what scaling a wall like Spiderman would feel like? While the average person may not possess the ability to actively climb skyscrapers like Peter Parker, a new innovative technology may just give you this freedom.  This technology is known as Geckskin, a new super-adhesive based on the mechanics of gecko feet.  This new innovative technology is pushing the boundary of what adhesives are capable of, and elevating the standard for the application of adhesives.  So, whether it’s a military soldier scaling a wall, or a consumer hanging a television in their home, the possibilities are endless for Geckskin. </p>

				<h3>The People</h3>
				<p>Behind this new technology lies the people responsible for this innovative development.  Specifically, two people at the University of Massachusetts.  Professor Al Crosby and Professor Duncan J Irschick.  Crosby, a Professor in Polymer Science, and Engineering field, is a materials scientist focusing on the mechanics of soft materials and biological systems. He was the initial leader of the group that initially developed Geckskin, and holds several patents for technologies that have been derived from his teams focus in the science and engineering field.  Duncan J Irschick, a Professor in the Biology department, mainly focuses on the evolution and ecology of animal athletics and how their biological form can influence synthetic design.  His research on gecko adhesion and animal movement have received many awards and honors, and Irschicks early research involving the adhesive force of gecko toepads, set the standard for other biologists creating synthetic adhesives.  These two scientists don’t compose the entire Geckskin team though, as multiple other PhD graduate students and doctoral candidates are enlisted in this development of Geckskin.</p>

				<h2>The Night Watch</h2>
				<p><span>October 15, 2017</span></p>
				<img src="nightwatch.jpg" alt="E-4b Nightwatch">

				<p>The E-4b (Night Watch) is a plane equipped with nuclear power that is used for emergency purposes only. The E-4b is the same plane as the Night Watch the E-4b is the scientific name for this technology. The plane will be used is in case we have another war. It is a militarized version of the Boeing, “747-200; the E-4b is a four-engine, swept-wing, long-range, high-altitude airplane capable of being refueled in flight. Its larger size provides approximately triple the floor space of the earlier EC-135 command post” (Mizokami, 2017, pg.1).With this information can help the reader understand what and how big the plane is and, how much of an improvement it is from the earlier EC-135 command post model. While the E-4b is an evolved version of the E-4A (Mizokami). The evolution of this plane from the E-4a to the E-4b can either be a good thing or bad thing for our country. It might draw in attention from other countries with its high amount of fire power in it. All of this will benefit the U.S in the coming future if we have war, on another country or for another world war making it World War III. It is built to survive EMP blast, and built to survive any major damage from an EMP. </p>

				<p>The Night Watch has not been active for awhile now since there has not been any major U.S alerting situations so far. The last time it was used in action was September 11th, of 2001; this was one of the last appearances of seeing it since it was first deployed in January 1980. The E-4b has, “advanced secure communications systems that would allow it to remain in contact with America’s nuclear forces in wartime” (Mizokami, 2017, pg.1). Mizokami goes into depth about how its secure communications systems that would allow it to communicate with the America’s nuclear force during war time. While the air force is prepared to replace them with a newer aircraft because these planes have been out date for awhile now. Improving them and loading them with current technology will benefit the president and our communication systems during war time. (This plane will be very useful if North Korea decided to strike the United States because the president will have the leverage to communicate with his fleet; and give commands to our army. </p>

				<h2>Iron Man and Exoskeletons</h2>
				<p><span>October 14, 2017</span></p>

				<p>The military has created many phenomenal inventions that have improved the life of both personnel and civilians alike. These inventions encourage freedom, ease burdens, and overall stun the imagination of all that believe these contraptions could be invented. Almost everyone across the world has dreamed of the possibility of a robotic suit since the comic book creation of Iron Man in the early 1960s. This once seemly so far away idea of an Iron Man-like weapon is not so far away. </p>
				<p>According to The National Interest, the United States military is developing and testing a next-generation Iron Man-like suit that is designed for protection and improved strength. These suits would help keep valuable US military operators alive when they engage in combat. The project is officially called TALOS, Tactical Light Operator Suit, and is aimed to enhance mobility and protection technologies for special operators, such as Special Forces and Navy SEALS, a Special Operations Command (SOCOM) statement said (Osborn). In Greek mythology Talos was a giant automation made of bronze to protect Crete (Ancient Origins). The TALOS if fully operational would be able to protect more than just the island Crete. </p>
