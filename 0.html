				<p>Have you ever wondered what scaling a wall like Spiderman would feel like? While the average person may not possess the ability to actively climb skyscrapers like Peter Parker, a new innovative technology may just give you this freedom.  This technology is known as Geckskin, a new super-adhesive based on the mechanics of gecko feet.  This new innovative technology is pushing the boundary of what adhesives are capable of, and elevating the standard for the application of adhesives.  So, whether it’s a military soldier scaling a wall, or a consumer hanging a television in their home, the possibilities are endless for Geckskin. </p>

				<h3>The People</h3>
				<p>Behind this new technology lies the people responsible for this innovative development.  Specifically, two people at the University of Massachusetts.  Professor Al Crosby and Professor Duncan J Irschick.  Crosby, a Professor in Polymer Science, and Engineering field, is a materials scientist focusing on the mechanics of soft materials and biological systems. He was the initial leader of the group that initially developed Geckskin, and holds several patents for technologies that have been derived from his teams focus in the science and engineering field.  Duncan J Irschick, a Professor in the Biology department, mainly focuses on the evolution and ecology of animal athletics and how their biological form can influence synthetic design.  His research on gecko adhesion and animal movement have received many awards and honors, and Irschicks early research involving the adhesive force of gecko toepads, set the standard for other biologists creating synthetic adhesives.  These two scientists don’t compose the entire Geckskin team though, as multiple other PhD graduate students and doctoral candidates are enlisted in this development of Geckskin.</p>

				<h3>The Science (How it works)</h3>
				<p>Geckskin is innovative and groundbreaking in many ways.  One of the main points that are stressed in terms of describing this product is its high weight capacity.  A key property of the Geckos feet is their ability to adhere to any surface, hold and significant amount of weight, and then detach with no residue and continue forward.  This is the main premise of Geckskin as this product is a derivation of the gecko studies.  Making a product that can exhibit these traits is not necessarily an easy feat.  Geckos and their ability to adhere to surfaces rely on a complex set of specializations for adhering to smooth surfaces.  This includes stiff tendons that insert into their toe pads, and on their toe pads, they possess millions of hairs called setae. These hairs act as a soft substrate and allow them to cling and conform to smooth surfaces.  Understanding the basic principles of the gecko feet, and how they can perform such fascinating actions such as climbing vertical walls and surfaces, we can then discuss the basis to Geckskin.  Geckskin is different in many ways to other pressure sensitive adhesives, and relies on the concept of draping adhesion.  This type of adhesion is created with materials that can drape to or conform with a surface, and maintain stiffness in the directions where stiffness is required.  This means that by using this type of adhesion, high elastic stiffness is achieved in the direction of the forces being applied, but is configured in a way that allows a low energy transition between the attachment and detachment of the material if a force is applied in another specific direction.  Geckskin is composed of stiff fabrics such as carbon fiber or Kevlar with other soft elastomers.  The key here is the composition of the stiff fabric, which acts as the skin, and the soft elastomer, which acts as the pad, and can drape over the necessary surfaces.  This composition is then woven into a synthetic tendon as the actual gecko feet possesses, and gives us the final design.  The direct connection between the tendon, skin, and elastomer pad is what allows the adhesion to work.  This design performs in a way that allows great stiffness but also rotational freedom for detachment purposes.  As Crosby stated, “The way we configure the tendon and the skin allows us to design how it will be removed, so there will be only one mechanism or one twist that will take off the pad.  Everything else will be stabilized.”  </p>


				<h3>The Manufacturing and Materials    </h3>
				<p>Geckskin is manufactured quite differently than other gecko inspired adhesives.  Other adhesives require expensive and complicated processes and techniques, while Geckskin takes a much simpler approach.  The creators rely on previous manufacturing techniques and focus on using everyday materials to create the adhesive.  One of these techniques was described as the simple coating of elastomers on fabrics, and initially only included nylon and a silicone elastomer.  “That day we held up about a hundred pounds.” Crosby stated regarding how simple and easy this process was.  Integration of materials and current manufacturing is obviously important to the Geckskin team, and that is the mindset moving forward, “The math behind Geckskin said that we can use almost any material to achieve this performance, that opened up our eyes and we started using materials that have less environmental impact.” said Crosby.  </p>

				<h3>The Application</h3>
				<p>The technology of Geckskin offers endless possibilities to where this material can be applied.  As previously stated, Geckskin can easily adhere to smooth surfaces, and attach, detach, and be reused elsewhere without leaving residue behind.  One of the main applications that is currently being considered is the use of Geckskin and U.S Military soldiers.  Since the Geckskin team has received funding from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), the military has seized the opportunity to help develop the research of this product.  The direct application for the military would be the development of climbing aids that would allow soldiers to scale walls and smooth surfaces while carrying significant amounts of gear and supplies.  Geckskin also has various uses in the medical field and scientific laboratories, as it does not leave a residue behind after detachment and would not compromise the lab environment.  Even NASA is considering the use of Geckskin as they see a possibility for catching space debris, and allowing robots to grasp ships to perform inspections and maintenance.  Also, this material has multiple uses when it becomes available to consumers.  Whether you are hanging a 50” T.V in your house or doing some home decorating, Geckskin can be the material of choice.  The developers realize this as well and have done tests of T.V mounting among other testing.  As stated on the main Geckskin site, the material is so powerful that an index card worth of Geckskin adhered to smooth glass or a smooth surface can hold 700 pounds while remaining to be easily detached and leave no residue behind.             </p>
				<h3>Sustainability and the Environment</h3>
				<p>The beautiful aspect of this product is that the Geckskin adhesive can be used for an application, and then reused for any other application you desire.  This means less wasted materials from other one and done adhesives that cannot be removed and used again.  Irschick even mentioned that you could put this adhesive in the washing machine and it will still perform!  The materials used for this product are common, readily available, and in most cases renewable.  There aren’t any special manufacturing methods that cause harm to the environment or waste substantial material, only simple methods that are widely known in the manufacturing world.  Geckskin is reusable, built with renewable materials, and prides itself with its simplicity, what more can you ask for?</p>

				<h3>The Future</h3>
				<p>As of right now, Geckskin does not seem to be readily available to the public, but the designers hope to continue getting the product ready for commercialization.  This product completely changes the way we look at adhesives both from the public view and the engineering/science standpoint.  Geckskin is simple to manufacture, uses common materials, offers reusability, eliminates waste, and above all, has fantastic science behind it.  This material can outperform the competition and whether it’s the U.S Military, NASA, or the common person, this material serves a purpose.</p>

				<p class=quote>"In order for something this large to use adhesion," Crosby says, "its tendons are stitched right into its skin. And so you have the tendon, which is very stiff tissue, connected to the skin and the setae. That direct connection is critical. Without that, the gecko could not use adhesion." This direct integration is what we ended up mimicking in Geckskin</p>
