				<h2>The Night Watch</h2>
				<p><span>October 15, 2017</span></p>
				<img src="nightwatch.jpg" alt="E-4b Nightwatch">

				<p>The E-4b (Night Watch) is a plane equipped with nuclear power that is used for emergency purposes only. The E-4b is the same plane as the Night Watch the E-4b is the scientific name for this technology. The plane will be used is in case we have another war. It is a militarized version of the Boeing, “747-200; the E-4b is a four-engine, swept-wing, long-range, high-altitude airplane capable of being refueled in flight. Its larger size provides approximately triple the floor space of the earlier EC-135 command post” (Mizokami, 2017, pg.1).With this information can help the reader understand what and how big the plane is and, how much of an improvement it is from the earlier EC-135 command post model. While the E-4b is an evolved version of the E-4A (Mizokami). The evolution of this plane from the E-4a to the E-4b can either be a good thing or bad thing for our country. It might draw in attention from other countries with its high amount of fire power in it. All of this will benefit the U.S in the coming future if we have war, on another country or for another world war making it World War III. It is built to survive EMP blast, and built to survive any major damage from an EMP. </p>

				<p>The Night Watch has not been active for awhile now since there has not been any major U.S alerting situations so far. The last time it was used in action was September 11th, of 2001; this was one of the last appearances of seeing it since it was first deployed in January 1980. The E-4b has, “advanced secure communications systems that would allow it to remain in contact with America’s nuclear forces in wartime” (Mizokami, 2017, pg.1). Mizokami goes into depth about how its secure communications systems that would allow it to communicate with the America’s nuclear force during war time. While the air force is prepared to replace them with a newer aircraft because these planes have been out date for awhile now. Improving them and loading them with current technology will benefit the president and our communication systems during war time. (This plane will be very useful if North Korea decided to strike the United States because the president will have the leverage to communicate with his fleet; and give commands to our army. </p>

				<p>The Night Watch will benefit our country by protecting the president and by being used during war time, and help our military systems. The plane will help benefit our military by helping protect our nation, and keeping our commander and chief safe in a secured location. In another article online that supports Mizokami’s information states, “The planes also have in-flight refueling and has been able to remain airborne and operational up to 35.4 hours” (Schmidt, 2017, pg.1). It has been designed to be able to operate flight for an entire week! With this plane being able to sustain flight for an entire week during a nuclear war would be perfect for the president. Not only will the president be aboard this plane, the secretary of defense, and the joint chief of staff will be aboard the night watch. The E-4b “Night watch” will be used in emergency cases, and, the president, secretary of defense, and the successors will be aboard the plane. Which will allow them to give military orders on whether to attack the country that is enforcing war on us, or telling them to lie low and wait it out. All in all, the E-4b is our future but it is eventually being replaced because it is old design, and if we add new technology to it, then it will be more lethal, and will be able to be more heavily armored. (So, then what is the next big thing?) The next plane is still yet to be discovered, and we shall see when the time comes, when another crisis hits. </p>

				<p>Our society will be impacted by the fact that it only protects our leaders, and not them personally. We will have to eventually decide whether or not is one life more important than thousands others? Society may be upset by the thought of their lives are being put at risk, while one “our president” is only protected. If there were multiple planes like the E-4b, and could protect the majority of our nation, then I believe they would be more relieved. The Night Watch being upgraded for future purposes may be developed into something more, and be big enough to cover the country. If technology advances far enough then there may be invisibility involved, which will help devise secret attacks or develop a cloak over the United States and hide our civilians and troops from danger. Invisibility is the ability to not be seen from the general public, to be cloaked completely. </p>

				<p>In a YouTube video shown on the site, it shows the inside of the plane, the different controls, and how it has a microwave and a fridge to store food, if they ever get hungry. It also shows, the different things equipped in the plane, and the difference between the 747 and the 747-200 “Night Watch.” It would fly, “a classified route over the United States, skirting obvious nuclear targets, theoretically staying in the air for days at a time” (Mizokami, 2017, pg.1). The route would be a secret route that no one would know about except the people inside of the plane. This gives the president leeway on where in the United States he’d like to go, and take base. Or if he would like to travel away from U.S to take refuge into a secret space for the United States, he has that option.</p>

				<p>In another article by Sebastien Roblin he talks about the E-6 Mercury, or the - 6 Sinister  and it does not carry any weapons, but it is still deadly. Its purpose is to maintain, “The communication link between the national command authority which starts with the president and secretary of defense and U.S. nuclear forces. In other words, you can chop off the head of the U.S. nuclear forces” (Roblin, 2017, pg.1). But the forces will still keep coming at you, from the doomsday planes. This in mind the newer edition of the E-4b will be a lot more lethal, and will be a far more-greater upgrade then the current plane right now. After the E-6 is running then other countries will be in trouble if they decide to attack our country, and we will be able to communicate with our military to be able to devise plans of attack. This could be a turning point for our country since now we have and are equipped with better artillery, and will keep us better suited for future attacks on our country; if we have any future attacks on the horizon.</p>

				<p>The Night Watch being upgraded to a new version compared to its older version will be a tremendous upgrade for future purposes. If we have another attack like 9/11, or if the crisis with North Korea erupts, then it will be a lot more useful in crisis situation if we decide to do battle with another country. The plane was built to survive drastic explosives with it being able to survive an EMP will be beneficial during war time. With all this Information on this plane and how it has evolved over time, only we control our fate, and how we decide to use our technology will determine if our decisions where smart or bad. Will our president make the correct choices on whether or not we should pursue, or go with attacking another country? If we pursue, then we will need to launch the Night Watch. </p>

				<p>In conclusion, the E-4b “Nightwatch” which may be the future of our nation and its artillery will help lead us to a successful and fairly even fight. A fight that will help our nation gain an edge over our enemies, and allow us to be victorious during war time. </p>
