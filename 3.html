				<h2>A Look at Light Attack Air Craft: An Economically Friendly Solution</h2>
				<p><span>by Nathan Nemiroff</span></p>

				<p>The United State’s modern air force boasts the most advanced aircraft the world has ever seen, and has developed and tested the very bleeding edge of aircraft effectiveness for decades.  This has kept the US ahead of the world and placed it at the very top of air superiority, currently being the only nation to field fifth generation aircraft, more than capable of defeating most other air forces with ease.</p>

				<p>However, today’s modern military operations aren’t usually fought against technologically advanced armies that can boast powerful weapon systems of their own.  Often times, they are rag tag groups of poorly equipped rebellions or terrorist groups, who’s only options for warfare end up being guerrilla tactics.</p>

				<p>This means for the mighty jets like the roughly $100 million F-35, less than 250 of which have been built and used in operation, the problem becomes akin to using a hacksaw to cut butter.  When every operational hour shortens the lifespan of your weapon system significantly, the infrastructure to use the system becomes expensive in and of itself, and the enemy being fought is as far behind technologically as they are numerous in countless difficult to find foxholes and caves, the use of the biggest guns with the biggest punch becomes restrictive, unable to face as many threats as quickly, and only able to do so with a force considered overkill for the operation.</p>

				<p>This is where the thus far largely ignored option of using light attack craft comes in.  The two main competitors for the spot, the A-29 Super Tucano and the AT-6 Wolverine, present a powerful weapons package and advanced technology sweep, akin to that used in fourth generation aircraft the US has used in the past, but do so on a much cheaper, lighter, and in some cases, more versatile airframe.</p>

				<p>The catch is, both of these aircraft use a turbo-prop engine as their method of propulsion, harkening back to the era of WWII to take advantage of a less powerful, less expensive, but no less versatile system.  This allows both of these designs to be built for less than $10 million per unit, far cheaper than the much heavier options available to the US today, beating out even the single-engine F-16, roughly estimated at $19 million.</p>

				<p>Their low weight, small frame, and cheap to maintain design allows them more flexibility than afforded to more powerful jets, capable of being shipped on and supplied from as little as “the back of a pickup truck”, and able to take off and land on much rougher terrain, allowing it to operate on many more impromptu runways and from forward bases inaccessible to a much larger jet.  From these small scale locations, it can carry out operations out to 800+ miles with more than enough firepower to eliminate the small scale operations many countries deal with today.</p>

				<p>Their inexpensive design and speculated equal if not longer lifespan, at least when comparing the A-29’s estimated lifespan of 12,000-18,000 operational hours and the F-22’s estimated 8,000 operational hours, will allow more of these units to be fielded more often and more effectively in high volume, low impact warfare, not only making it as effective as the current aircraft fielded for this purpose, but much more economically effective as well, putting a lot less strain on the military’s budget and giving a lot more power to on duty air divisions.</p>

				<p>The US has so far accepted the battle tested Brazillian A-29 Super Tucano for use in training and has announced plans to begin using it in special cases.  Sales of the aircraft through the US to Afghanistan and Nigeria have likewise been authorized to aid in anti-terrorist warfare, giving the US at least another option for offering supporting aid with less powerful systems to forces it doesn’t want to fully trust or support.  It is unclear whether the US will use these aircraft more prominently in their own operations, but there is the possibility for further research into a permanent light attack role.</p>

				<p>While these aircraft aren’t the most powerful design, they still provide an interesting route in future design philosophy for cost effective presentations of power that may become very valuable in the future.</p>
